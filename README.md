# WebAppPackage
A generic HTML-GUI starter package for web applications.

The basic building blocks for the standard appearance of a graphical user interface in HTML5, details for the particular project loaded in asynchronously and fully responsive layout, which is also independent of the server side scripting language transmitting those details 

Java, Python, and PHP examples here, only the critical source files are included here to copy and paste into a new project with desired server-side langauge in preferred IDE.


Aside from the basic GUI Elements (main menu, hamburger menu, etc.) I have started creating a few widgets that aren't available as a single HTML element: tab-panes, list boxes, went ahead and grouped radio buttons together since they're not individual items, and a combo box since the select/option HTML elements can't be styled with CSS. The plan has the server-side script echo back detailed instances of this html code, but that's still way down the line, so a copy, paste, and modify thing for now.
